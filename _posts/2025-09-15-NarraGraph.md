title: NarraGraph – Visualizing Stories 
---

After a year of working on it as a hobby project, [Narragraph](https://narragraph.com) is finally live!

NarraGraph is a tool for writers, worldbuilders, and TTRPG DMs to visualize how characters, places, and events connect and evolve over time. Think of it as a “Google Maps” for story graphs: interactive, clear, and designed to make complex narratives easier to explore.


Working on NarraGraph was a full-stack learning experience, from picking the right technologies to integrating them smoothly:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Material-UI  
- **Graph visualization:** Cytoscape.js  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Kùzu, SQLite  
- **Cloud infrastructure:** Google Cloud Storage, Firebase, Google Compute Engine  
- **UI/UX design:** observing user behavior to improve interface and interactions  
- **Software architecture:** data schemas and specifications  
- **Testing:** pytest for unit tests  
- **Version control:** structured Git workflow on GitHub  

It’s been really rewarding to turn a simple idea into a fully functional tool outside of my day-to-day work.

### Story Progression in Action

Here’s a short video showing how a story unfolds in NarraGraph:
