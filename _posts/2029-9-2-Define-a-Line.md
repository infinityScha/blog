## Statement of the Problem and Description of the Cahn-Hilliad-Cook Model
### Intro
During my BSc, I interned in Prague. I was given the following, seemingly simple, task: locate the interface between the liquid-ordered (L<sub>o</sub>) and liquid-disordered (L<sub>d</sub>) phases within (simulated) lipid membranes.

The interest in these phases comes from  lipid raftsâ€”microdomains that organize cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. Studying these phases helps elucidate how lipid rafts influence cellular processes and disease mechanisms, providing insights into cell function and potential therapeutic targets.
