#### Lipid Nanodiscs Elasticity

- **Description:** Investigated the elastic properties of lipid nanodiscs, nanometric bilayer patches enveloped by membrane scaffolding proteins (MSPs). Employed a computational approach, based on molecular dynamics simulations, to quantify bending rigidity (KC) and tilt modulus (Îºt) on a local scale. The study also incorporated a continuum elastic theory, considering lipid bending, tilting, and area deformations, to analyze the nanodisc shape. Results revealed that nanodiscs exhibit unique material properties compared to infinite bilayers of corresponding lipid composition, showing higher stiffness and spatial variations in moduli.

- **Elastic Theory:**
  - The study applied a continuum elastic theory to understand the interplay between MSP geometry, lipid confinement, and nanodisc shape.
  - Analytic expressions derived under simplifying assumptions demonstrated sensitivity of the nanodisc shape to its size, lipid density, and lipid tilt and thickness at the MSP contact.
  - The equilibrium nanodisc shape was determined by minimizing the elastic free energy functional, providing a quantitative understanding of nanodisc deformations.
  - The bending rigidity was novely extracted from the membrane shape profile through fitting the numerically minimized full elastic functional to the membrane shape found in simulations.

- **Significance:** Findings emphasize the importance of considering nanodisc deformations and material properties when interpreting structural and functional implications for embedded proteins. The integration of a continuum elastic theory offers a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between nanodisc structure and membrane material properties.
