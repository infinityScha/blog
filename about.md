I'm a dedicated cotutelle PhD Candidate concurrently enrolled at Charles University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, with a focus on multi-scale modeling of biophysical membrane processes. My expertise spans various levels of numerical simulations, ranging from Molecular Dynamics at the atomic scale to macroscopic Continuum Modeling, employing techniques like Finite Element Analysis and Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. Grounded in a robust background in both Natural Sciences and Mathematics, I'm enthusiastic about contributing to cutting-edge research at the confluence of chemistry, mathematics, and computational physics. Keen to explore collaborative opportunities!
