I am a cotutelle PhD candidate at Charles University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focusing on multi-scale modeling of biophysical membrane processes. My research involves numerical simulations, from atomic-scale Molecular Dynamics to macroscopic Continuum Modeling, using methods like Finite Element Analysis and Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. With a background in Natural Sciences and Mathematics, I’m particularly interested in statistics, data analysis, and computational approaches to complex problems. Looking to contribute to challenging and impactful work.
