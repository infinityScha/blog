I am a cotutelle PhD candidate at Charles University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focusing on multi-scale modeling of biophysical membrane processes. My research spans numerical simulations from atomic-scale Molecular Dynamics to macroscopic Continuum Modeling, using methods such as Finite Element Analysis and Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. With a background in Natural Sciences and Mathematics, I am particularly interested in statistics, data analysis, and computational approaches to complex problems. I am motivated by challenging projects where I can contribute to impactful scientific work.

Outside the lab, I enjoy weightlifting, tinkering with computational and mathematical tools, and reading mangas.
